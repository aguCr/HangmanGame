# Hangman Game
A hangman terminal game made without any prior python knowledge on a weekend (3 days)<br>
The code is a bit messy, but I just wanted to explore the python basics <br>
To play the game you need to install python. To start the game you can click on the file or type in the terminal inside the correct directory: python Hangman.py <br>
